# **My Portfolio**

Welcome to my portfolio website!  
This site showcases my skills, projects, and experiences. Initially, I started building this site using Python and Flask, but I transitioned to using pure HTML and CSS to host it on GitHub Pages. I now use Visual Studio Code to update and expand the site.
