        <p>
          Hello! My name is Matthew Rohrbach, and I am an aspiring programmer
          with a passion for growth and learning. My career journey has been
          diverse, spanning roles in retail at Walmart, fast food
          establishments, and primarily factory work. These experiences have
          shaped my work ethic and adaptability. Seeking a more fulfilling and
          dynamic career path, I made the decision to pursue a degree in
          computer science, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie
          ahead in the tech industry."
          <br />
          <br />
          Since I started my journey I have enjoyed learning the fundamentals of
          Python and MySQL, along with intermediate skills in libraries such as
          Pandas and Matplotlib. My focus has recently shifted towards data,
          particularly databases. Although I do not have professional
          achievements in this field yet, I have dedicated significant time to
          learning and honing my skills both in school and on my own time.
