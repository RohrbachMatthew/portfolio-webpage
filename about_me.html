        <p>
          Hello! My name is Matthew Rohrbach, and I am an aspiring programmer
          with a passion for growth and learning. <br />
          My career journey has been diverse, spanning roles in retail at
          Walmart, fast food establishments, and primarily <br />
          factory work. These experiences have shaped my work ethic and
          adaptability. Seeking a more fulfilling and <br />
          dynamic career path, I made the decision to pursue a degree in
          computer science, and I am excited about the <br />
          opportunities that lie ahead in the tech industry."
          <br />
          <br />
          I have since learned the fundamentals of Python and MySQL, along with
          intermediate skills in libraries such as <br />
          Pandas and Matplotlib. My focus has recently shifted towards data,
          particularly databases. Although I do <br />
          not have professional achievements in this field yet, I have dedicated
          significant time to learning and honing my <br />
          skills both in school and on my own.
