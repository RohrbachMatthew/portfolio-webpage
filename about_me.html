        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm <strong>Matthew Rohrbach</strong>, an aspiring programmer
          with a deep passion for growth and lifelong learning. My career path
          has been shaped by a variety of hands-on roles including factory
          work—which have instilled in me a strong work ethic and adaptability.
          Driven by the desire for a more fulfilling and future-forward career,
          I made the decision to pursue a degree in
          <strong>Computer Science</strong>, and I’m excited about where the
          journey is taking me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since beginning my studies, I’ve built a strong foundation in
          <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>, and have actively
          pursued intermediate tools like <strong>Pandas</strong> and
          <strong>Matplotlib</strong>. What began as a curriculum requirement
          quickly turned into a personal mission—I regularly devote time outside
          of school to dive deeper into database design, data pipelines, and
          backend development. My growing fascination with data has become a
          self-driven journey, fueled by curiosity and long hours of independent
          research, hands-on projects, and skill-building. While I haven’t yet
          entered the tech field professionally, I’ve invested extensive energy
          and discipline—both academically and on my own—to sharpen my
          capabilities and prepare for meaningful work in the industry.
